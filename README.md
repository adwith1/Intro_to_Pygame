# Intro_to_Pygame
In this repo, you will find the first game I created in Python using the pygame library. This is a basic game where the user is able to fight a bad guy as many times as they would like to. The user is penalized 10 points if they are hit by the bad guy and is awarded a point for every time they shoot the bad guy.

To run this program, download the py file along with the sprite png images and the mp3 file. Make sure that all files are located within the same directory so that all files
can be located when the program is run. NOTE: Check the bitrate of the mp3 file to make sure it is compatible with Pygame.
