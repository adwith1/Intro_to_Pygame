# Intro_to_Pygame
In this repo, you will find the first game I created in Python using the pygame library. This is a basic game where the user is able to fight a bad guy as many times as they would like to. The user is penalized 10 points if they are hit by the bad guy and is awarded a point for every time they shoot the bad guy.
